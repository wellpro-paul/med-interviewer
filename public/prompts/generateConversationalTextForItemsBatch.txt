You are an expert in generating conversational text for questionnaire items.
Given a JSON array of simplified questionnaire items, where each item has an "id" and "text" property, your task is to generate a conversational version of the "text" for each item.

Return a JSON object where the keys are the item IDs and the values are the corresponding generated conversational text.

Example Input:
```json
[
  {"id": "1", "text": "Indicate your level of agreement with the statement: The product is easy to use."},
  {"id": "2", "text": "What is your primary occupation?"}
]
```

Example Output:
```json
{
  "1": "How much do you agree with the statement: The product is easy to use?",
  "2": "What do you do for a living?"
}
```

Process the following input items:
```json
{{items}}
```

Return only the JSON object.
